??This is a step-by-step guide on installing node.js inside Windows XP through Portable Ubuntu TRES:??


*1.* Download and unpack "Portable Ubuntu TRES":http://portableubuntu.demonccc.com.ar/en/download (self-extracting).

*2.* Open *config/portable_ubuntu.conf* in your favourite text editor and add the following around line *61*:

<pre>ports_to_redirect=tcp:8000:8000</pre>

*3.* Double-click to run *pubuntu.exe*.

*4.* Open up *Terminal* from the *Applications/Accessories* menu and type:

<pre>sudo gedit /etc/init.d/postmount_pubuntu.sh</pre>
The sudo password by default is: @123456@

*5.* Replace line *52* with the following (this is to fix a nasty bug that freezes Portable Ubuntu TRES when launching for a second time):

<pre>echo >> /etc/fstab
echo "#Entry for cdrom" >> /etc/fstab
echo "/dev/cdrom /media/cdrom udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8" >> /etc/fstab</pre>

*6.* Save and close gedit.

*7.* Still inside the terminal type the following (one line at a time):

<pre>sudo apt-get install g++ git-core libssl-dev curl apache2-utils
git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
cd node
./configure
make
sudo make install</pre>


That's all! You now can run node.js by typing in the terminal:

<pre>node <your_app.js></pre>

and you can go back to Windows and point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000 and it should work, provided you have the server listening to *port 8000* (if you want to use another port you need to edit *portable_ubuntu.conf* as described in step *2*). "Here are a few Hello World examples with code":http://howtonode.org/hello-node to get you started quickly, and "here is the list of available modules":http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/modules you can use with node.js to extend its functionality (frameworks, database connection, etc.) ??[Warning: "Not all of them work":http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/library-compatibility with the latest version of node.js]??.

??Extra Tips:?? 

* To share a folder between Windows and Portable Ubuntu edit *portable_ubuntu.conf* around line *38*:
<pre>shared_folder0=C:\your\folder</pre>and you should find it under the */media/* path in Ubuntu (always after restarting having edited the config file)

* You should also *deactivate the screensaver* in Ubuntu by going to the *System/Preferences/ScreenSaver menu* because it might lock the menu and the windows you have opened with no way of gaining access again (another annoying bug).
